is serving as the drivestation for your robot. This will contain Python
Scripts to do client side vision process and SmartDashboard setups

RaspberryPi conatins all the code that will run on the raspberry Pi's
robot side. Its, empty rn but I am porting the driver sation vision code 
to the raspberry pi so it can do Vision processing server side. 

This is a definite work in progress, still learning a lot of things(mainly 
how to use github properly) but hopefully his repo ends up helping another 
team out with vision processing
